1. Explore the trace. Thread 0 represents the main thread of an MPI process. Threads 4-12
   are OpenMP workers. Threads 500-532 represent GPU streams.

2. Look at the profile, especially the bottom-up view. Sort by exclusive CPU time and go
   to the top of the column. Where do the CPU threads spend most of their time?
