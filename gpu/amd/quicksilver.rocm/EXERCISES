Quicksilver exercises

Using a measurement database with traces that was collected *without*
PC sampling enabled:

1. Use the Filter menu to select Filter Execution Contexts. In the 
   filtering menu, select "Uncheck all". Now, in the empty box preceded
   by "Filter:", type "GPU" and then click "Check all". Select "OK". Now, the Trace View 
   will show only trace lines for the GPUs. Is the work load balanced across
   the GPUs? How can you tell?

2. Bring up the filter menu again. Select "Uncheck all". Type in "RANK 3" in the
   Filter box. Select thread 0 and the GPU context. Select "OK". What is thread 0 doing
   when the GPU is idle?  Does this suggest any optimization opportunities?
