To build, depending upon your host, type one of the following

	make platform=vesta
	make platform=cetus
	make platform=theta

OMPT support for OpenMP is available with GNU, Clang, and intel compilers but not IBM's xl compilers

Only a few things have been modified for studying this application with HPCToolkit
- HPCToolkit's hpclink command is assigned to HPCLINK at the bottom of Makefile.include so it will be used to wrap the link.
- The LLVM OpenMP library is added to the link line (overriding GNU, Clang, and Intel OpenMP runtimes)
