1. use the trace view to identify the main phases of the program. proceed top down.  
2. what is the most salient feature that you see in the trace? 
3. is the program running efficiently?
4. use the color map menu to map *yield* and *barrier* to white. does this affect your conclusions about the program execution?
5. use the top-down view to inspect the application performance. are the threads distinguishable in this view? 
6. what does the time spent in <omp barrier> at the top level mean?
7. select <program root>. use the flame button to look down the dominant call path. do you see information at the loop level?
8. use the bottom up view to see where it spends most of its time. use the flame button to look up the call chain to see how it gets there.
9. experiment with halving the number of threads by changing OMP_NUM_THREADS in the job-script for your platform.
   how does that affect the efficiency and the execution time?
