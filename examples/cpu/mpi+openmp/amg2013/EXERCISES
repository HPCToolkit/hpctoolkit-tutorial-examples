               Analyzing and experimenting with AMG2013
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Use the trace view to identify the main phases of the program. proceed
   top down. At depth 2, you will see that the program has two principal 
   phases, along with some others, e.g. before each MPI rank launches
   OpenMP threads.

2. What is the most striking feature of the setup phase?

3. Is the program running efficiently?

3. Zoom in to analyze the solve phase in detail. Do you see load 
   imbalance among the threads? If so, does it have a consistent pattern?

3. Switch to the profile view. Use the bottom up view to see where it 
   spends most of its time. use the flame button to look up the call 
   chain to see how it gets there.

4. Experiment with halving the number of thread by changing
   OMP_NUM_THREADS in the job-script for your platform.  How does that
   affect the efficiency and the execution time?

5. Edit the job-script for your platform to comment out the module load
   of openmp/ompt (if present). measure the program execution again. how
   does your view of the execution differ without the OpenMP tools
   interface?
