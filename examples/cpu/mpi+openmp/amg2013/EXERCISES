               Analyzing and experimenting with AMG2013
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Use the trace view to identify the main phases of the program. proceed
   top down.

2. Is the program running efficiently?

3. Use the bottom up view to see where it spends most of its time. use
   the flame button to look up the call chain to see how it gets there.

4. Experiment with halving the number of thread by changing
   OMP_NUM_THREADS in the job-script for your platform.  How does that
   affect the efficiency and the execution time?

5. Edit the job-script for your platform to comment out the module load
   of openmp/ompt (if present). measure the program execution again. how
   does your view of the execution differ without the OpenMP tools
   interface?
