Quicksilver exercises

Using a measurement database with traces that was collected *without*
PC sampling enabled:

1. Use the trace view to look at the CPU and GPU traces. What is 
   happening on the CPU when the GPU is idle? Does this suggest
   any optimization opportunities? 

Using a measurement database with traces that was collected *with*
PC sampling enabled:

3. Use the bottom-up view in the profile to identify the GPU function or
inlined function that causes the most instruction stalls. 

 a. What is the cause of these stalls (which stall kind)?  

 b. Where is this function called from? Could some of the calls be 
    eliminated?

3. What function causes 8% of the GPU instruction stalls? Can you 
   envision a strategy that would reduce that?
